Simple chordophones or zithers (31)
Main article: List of musical instruments by Hornbostel-Sachs number: 31
Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable (although it may result in quite a different sound being produced).

Swordblade
Whip
Interruptive free aerophones (412)
The air-stream is interrupted periodically

412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds - The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a 'cover,' i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed's vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes.

412.11 Concussion reeds - Two lamellae make a gap which closes periodically during their vibration.

412.12 Percussion reeds - A single lamella strikes against a frame.

412.121 Independent percussion reeds.

412.13 Free-reed instruments feature a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot (there may be an attached pipe, but it should only vibrate in sympathy with the reed, and not have an effect on the pitch - instruments of this class can be distinguished from 422.3 by the lack of finger-holes).
